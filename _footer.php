        <h2 class="t24 oj text-center mt0"><strong>About <em>BOLD:  How to Go Big, Create Wealth and Impact the World</em></strong></h2>
        <div style="margin-left:20px;">
          <p>From the coauthors of the #2 New York Times bestseller <em>Abundance</em> comes their much anticipated follow-up: <em>BOLD</em>—a radical, how-to guide to using exponential technologies, moonshot thinking and crowd-powered tools to create extraordinary wealth in your own life while simultaneously creating a world of abundance.</p>
          <p>In <em>Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think</em>, Peter H. Diamandis and Steven Kotler explored how four potent emerging forces—exponential technologies, the DIY innovator, technophilanthropists and the rising billion—give us the power to solve many of the world's grandest challenges and the potential to meet the needs of every man, woman and child over the next two to three decades. In <em>BOLD</em>, they offer the next step: a highly practical playbook that arms today's entrepreneurs, activists and leaders with the tools they'll need to positively impact the lives of billions while making their biggest dreams come true.</p>  
          <p><em>BOLD</em> unfolds in three parts.  Part One focuses on the exponential technologies which are disrupting today's Fortune 500 companies and enabling upstart entrepreneurs to go from 'I've got an idea' to 'I run a billion-dollar company' far faster than ever before. With advice garnered from their own experience and hundreds of interviews with Silicon Valley elite, the authors provide exceptional insight into how anyone can harness the power of 3D printing, artificial intelligence, robotics, networks and sensors, and synthetic biology—the very technologies enabling today's entrepreneurs to tackle the kinds of enormous challenges that were once only possible for governments and major corporations. Part Two of the book focuses on Psychology of Bold—the mental toolkit that allows the world's top innovators to raise their game by thinking at scale, including detailed interviews with and lessons from Larry Page, Elon Musk, Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos. Also in Part Two, Kotler reveals the keys to ultimate human performance garnered from fifteen years of research with the Flow Genome Project and Diamandis reveals his entrepreneurial secrets garnered from building fifteen companies, including such audacious ventures as Singularity University, the XPRIZE, Planetary Resources (for the mining of near-Earth Asteroids) and Human Longevity, Inc. (focused on extending the healthy human life-span).  Finally, <em>BOLD</em> closes with a look at the incredible power and essential best practices that allow anyone to leverage today's hyper-connected crowd like never before. Here, Diamandis and Kotler teach how to design and use incentive competitions to find breakthrough solutions, how to launch million-dollar crowdfunding campaigns to tap into ten's of billions of dollars of available capital, and finally how to build communities – armies of exponentially enabled individuals willing and able to help today's entrepreneurs make their boldest dreams come true.</p>
          <p><em>BOLD: How to Go Big, Create Wealth and Impact the World</em> is both a manifesto and a manual. It is today's exponential entrepreneur's go-to resource on the use of emerging technologies, thinking at scale, and the awesome power of crowd-powered tools like crowdfunding, crowdsourcing and incentive competitions. All around us, technology is democratizing the power to change the world, and <em>BOLD</em> spells out how anyone can spy the opportunities and put their vision into action, blazing a path from mind to market.</p>

        <h2 class="t24 oj text-center"><strong>About the Book Cover</strong></h2>
        <div style="margin-left:20px;">
          <p>The BOLD Book Cover show's the Earth being hit by an asteroid.  What is the relevance of this image?</p>
          <p>66 million years ago, dinosaurs were the uber-dominant species on Earth. But when an asteroid collided with our planet—unleashing everything from mega-tsunamis to global firestorms—these creatures were unable to adapt to the upheaval and instead went extinct.</p>         
          <p>For our species, this was very good news. While the dinosaurs were large, lumbering and inflexible, those early small, furry mammals—our ancestors—were far more nimble and resilient. They took opportunistic advantage of the radical changes sweeping the globe, adapted to their new environment, and never looked back.</p>         
          <p>In today's business world, this tale is especially relevant. Right now there is another asteroid impacting our world—it's called: “exponential technology.” And its awesome power is threatening a different breed of dinosaur—large and innovation-resistant companies. Yet there's a new breed of small, furry mammal starting to emerge. These mammals are today's exponential entrepreneurs—those using radically accelerating technologies to transform products, services and industries to pave the way for a world of abundance.</p>
